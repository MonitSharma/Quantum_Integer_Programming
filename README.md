# Quantum Integer Programming Course 

This course is primarily designed for graduate students (and advanced undergraduates) interested in integer programming (with non-linear objective functions) and the potential of near-term quantum computing for solving combinatorial optimization problems.
By the end of it, someone enrolled in this course should be able to:
- Identify the current status of quantum computing and its potential uses for integer programming
- Access and use quantum computing resources (such as DWave Quantum Annealers)
- Set up a given integer program to be solved with quantum computing 
- Work in groups collaboratively on a state-of-the-art project regarding applications of quantum computing and integer programming

This course is not going to focus on the following topics:
- Quantum Gates and Circuits
- Computational complexity theory
- Quantum Information Theory
- Analysis of speedup using differential geometry, algebraic topology, etc.
